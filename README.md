# *CaLenDiR*-PPM

### Under construction...
___
This repository is set to contain the entire source code for the ***CaLenDiR PPM framework***, proposed in the paper **CaLenDiR: Mitigating Case-Length Distortion in Deep-Learning-Based Predictive Process Monitoring**, submitted to the [ML4PM](https://ml4pm.di.unimi.it/) workshop, part of the [ICPM 2024](https://icpmconference.org/2024/) conference. 

At the moment, to support the integration of the ***CaLenDiR*** framework into other research projects and contribute to the advancement of the PPM field, the authors are finetuning the documentation of the code, as well as the detailled project description (README) containing supplementary materials and detailed instructions on how to leverage the ***CaLenDir*** framework for Deep-Learning-based Predictive Process Monitoring. 

> The complete repository, including extensive documentation and further instructions, is set to be released on **Wednesday 28/08/2024**. 

As mentioned in the paper, the experimental setup extends on the setup from our previous paper, ***SuTraN: an Encoder-Decoder Transformer for FullContext-Aware Suffix Prediction of Business Processes***, accepted at the **ICPM 2024 main track**. The meticulously documented repository, [SuffixTransformerNetwork](https://github.com/BrechtWts/SuffixTransformerNetwork/tree/main) , including all reimplementations, is already made available [here](https://github.com/BrechtWts/SuffixTransformerNetwork/tree/main). This repository also comprises an extensive project description, further detailling all implementations, as well as providing clear instructions on how to get started with the code. A preprint of the accepted ***SuTraN*** paper, will also be communicated at the same day of the release of the ***CaLenDiR-PPM*** repository (*Wednesday 28/08/2024*).
